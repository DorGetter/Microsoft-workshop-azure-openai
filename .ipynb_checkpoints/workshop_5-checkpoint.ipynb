    "# Workshop 5: Router Agent with Multiple Function Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final workshop, we will integrate the various function calls we have developed in previous workshops into a single, cohesive router agent using Azure OpenAI. This router agent will be capable of handling complex user requests by utilizing multiple predefined function tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Set Up the Environment:**\n",
    "   - Import the necessary libraries and helper modules containing our predefined function tools.\n",
    "   - Configure the Azure OpenAI client using the API key and endpoint.\n",
    "   - Connect to the SQLite database containing employee information to ensure it is accessible for querying employee details.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define System and Tools:**\n",
    "   - Create a system message to set the context for the assistant, ensuring it understands its role and capabilities.\n",
    "   - Utilize predefined JSON objects for function calls, including detailed descriptions to ensure precise interactions and data retrieval from the database.\n",
    "   - List and map the predefined functions (e.g., scheduling meetings, sending emails, querying the database) and create tool definitions for these functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **User Interaction and Integration:**\n",
    "   - Provide an example of a user interacting with the router agent, demonstrating how the agent can handle multiple tasks using the predefined function tools based on the user's requests.\n",
    "   - Implement an interactive chat loop where the agent processes user inputs, executes the necessary actions using the defined functions, and responds accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this workshop, you will see how to integrate and utilize multiple function tools within a single agent to handle complex and multi-step user requests efficiently. This demonstration will show the practical application of combining various predefined function calls to create a robust and versatile assistant.\n"

    "# Challenge: Implement Additional Tools for the Router Agent\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will expand the capabilities of our router agent by adding a new function tool. This exercise will help you understand how to integrate additional functionality into the agent, enhancing its ability to handle a wider range of user requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Challenge Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understand the Existing Framework:**\n",
    "   - Review the predefined function tools and their integration into the router agent.\n",
    "   - Understand the structure of the function call JSON objects and how they interact with the agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement a New Function Tool:**\n",
    "   - Create a new function tool to manage a to-do list by adding tasks and retrieving the list of tasks.\n",
    "   - Ensure the tool is well-documented with a clear description and parameter definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tool: To-Do List Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a tool that allows the user to add tasks to a to-do list and retrieve the list of tasks. This tool should handle adding a task with a description and retrieving the current list of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integrate the New Tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add the new function tool (manage_todo) to the router agent.\n",
    "- Update the list of available functions and their mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Test the New Tool:\n",
    "- Interact with the agent to test the new tool, ensuring it functions correctly.\n",
    "- Verify that the agent can handle multiple tasks seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this challenge, you will enhance your understanding of integrating additional function tools into an agent and improve your ability to handle complex user interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary>Click me for the solution</summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Function:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "todo_list = []\n",
    "\n",
    "def manage_todo(action: str, task: str = None):\n",
    "    if action == \"add\" and task:\n",
    "        todo_list.append(task)\n",
    "        return {\"message\": \"Task added successfully.\", \"task\": task}\n",
    "    elif action == \"retrieve\":\n",
    "        return {\"todo_list\": todo_list}\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return {\"error\": \"Invalid action or missing task.\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Integration Steps:**\n",
    "1. Add the Function Tool to the List of Available Functions:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "available_functions = {\n",
    "    \"manage_todo\": manage_todo,\n",
    "    # Add other functions here\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Update the Router Agent to Handle the New Tool:\n",
    "Ensure the tools list includes the manage_todo tool and the agent can call it when requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Test the Integration:\n",
    "Test adding and retrieving tasks using the agent to ensure the new tool works as expected.\n",
    "\n",
